# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| latest mainnet deployment | Yes |
| previous mainnet deployment | Security fixes only |
| older | No |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open public issues or pull requests for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report vulnerabilities through one of these channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory** (preferred): Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/mux-labs/mux-contracts/security/advisories/new) and click "Report a vulnerability".
2. **Email**: Send a description to **security@mux-protocol.xyz**

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

| Stage | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Acknowledgment | 48 hours |
| Triage & severity assessment | 5 business days |
| Fix for critical/high severity | 14 business days |
| Public disclosure (coordinated) | 30 business days after fix |

We will work with you to understand and validate the issue before any public disclosure.

## Scope

The following are in scope for security reports:

- **Soroban smart contracts** under `contracts/` — logic bugs, authorization bypasses, storage griefing, overflow/underflow, reentrancy
- **TypeScript bindings** under `bindings/` — error handling flaws that could cause loss of funds or unauthorized actions
- **Deployment scripts** under `scripts/` — key management, access control during deployment
- **Configuration** — `config/addresses.json` exposure, network passphrase misconfiguration

The following are **out of scope**:

- Soroban runtime or Stellar network consensus issues (report to [Stellar](https://stellar.org/bug-bounty))
- Denial-of-service against infrastructure (RPC nodes,Horizon servers) unrelated to contract logic
- Social engineering attacks

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service disruption
- Only interact with accounts you own or have explicit permission to test
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and do not publicly disclose details before a fix is deployed

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow these guidelines.

## Threat Model

See [docs/threat-model.md](docs/threat-model.md) for the current threat model, trust boundaries, and known mitigations.

## Partial Crate Rollback

Partial rollback is a privileged, money-path-adjacent surface. It is authorized
server-side (owner/delegate/guardian/API-key/JWT), deny-by-default, idempotent via
correlation ids, and fails closed on RPC/DB/Horizon outages. Rollback logs redact
keys, JWTs, and webhook secrets. See [docs/rollback-guide.md](docs/rollback-guide.md)
for invariants, stable error codes, and the flag/kill-switch strategy.

## Audit History

See [docs/audit-prep.md](docs/audit-prep.md) for audit preparation notes and the [docs/access-control-checklist.md](docs/access-control-checklist.md) for the access control review checklist.
